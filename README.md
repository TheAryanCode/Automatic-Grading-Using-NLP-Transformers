## 🛠️ Usage

### 📊 Data Preparation

This project includes various datasets essential for training and evaluating the models:

- **Auto-Tokenizer**
- **GPT-2**
- **MathBERT**

### 🔄 Embedding Conversion

The project provides scripts to convert text data into embeddings:

- `AUTOTOKEN_CONVERTER.py`: Convert text using Auto-Tokenizer.
- `GPT2.ipynb`: Work with GPT-2 embeddings.
- `mathbertconversion.py`: Convert text using MathBERT embeddings.

### 🧠 Model Training

Train your models using Jupyter Notebooks available in the repository:

- Training stages from `TRAINING-1.ipynb` to `TRAINING-4.ipynb`.
- Additional resources for CatBoost model training.

### ✅ Testing and Evaluation

Test the models and evaluate their performance using:

- `TESTING & LR TRAINING RESULTS.ipynb`: Document the testing and training results.

## 📈 Results

Detailed results from the testing and training processes are available within the Jupyter Notebooks and the paper present in the repository, providing insights into model performance.
